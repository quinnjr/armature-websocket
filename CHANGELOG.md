## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `tungstenite` (0.29 → 0.30) is a public dependency — `RawMessage`, `CloseFrame` and the `tungstenite::Message` conversions are part of this crate's API — so the upgrade is breaking and the minor moves.

### Security

- Require `rustls` 0.23.45 or later, which fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0285 (TLS 1.3 handshake messages accepted across encryption-level boundaries).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Requirements on sibling armature crates name a minor instead of `0`. Under
  Cargo's 0.x rules `version = "0"` matches any release ever made, and edition
  2024 selects the MSRV-aware resolver, so a consumer declaring an older
  `rust-version` was handed the oldest version satisfying it — resolving
  `armature-core = "0"` on Rust 1.89 produced `armature-core 0.2.3` while an
  explicit `armature-core = "0.8"` elsewhere in the same graph pulled 0.8.2.
  Two copies of core, and a build failing on symbols the older one lacks. Each
  0.x minor in this family is a breaking change, so the requirement now names
  one. No API change.
